# CMB-power-spectrum
# The python script compared the $\Lambda CDM$ model and the Planck CMB power spectrum data. The model parameters can be changed to see how the input value of those parameters can affect the final power spectrum.  
# One can run the python file by downding both the python and the power.csv files or operate the file in google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E1iXM9x4-haHYOl8lVy_xYIgN7iaQicP#scrollTo=j188Oruim-nS) without installing anything in your own laptop.
